### Who Are We?

FIPGL23 is an organization that provides reliable and effective solutions based on scientific research in the fight against Feline Infectious Peritonitis (FIP) disease to cat owners and veterinarians.

Our goal is not only to provide products but also to provide accurate information and guidance to pet owners during this challenging process.

### Our Core Values

*   **Reliability and Transparency:** We have adopted the principle of being transparent in all steps from the supply process to the end-user and keeping our promises.
*   **High Quality Standards:** Our products are manufactured in accordance with internationally recognized **GMP (Good Manufacturing Practices)** and **GLP (Good Laboratory Practices)** standards.

### Our Ethical Approach

While continuing our activities, we act not only with commercial concerns but within the framework of ethical rules. We prioritize animal health, environmental safety, and human health above everything else.

### Our Vision

Our vision is to shatter the perception that FIP disease is "untreatable and fatal," proving that every cat has a chance to live, and offering globally accessible treatment solutions.

> "We are constantly improving ourselves to keep customer satisfaction at the highest level and to go beyond expectations. The health of your soulmates is our greatest priority."
