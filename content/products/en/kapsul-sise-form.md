## What does Capsule Bottle Form mean?

Capsule bottle form products usually involve the use of active ingredients contained within gelatin or vegetable capsules. These types of products show their effect as the capsule's content dissolves in the digestive system and can usually be given directly to the cat's mouth or applied by hiding it in its food.

Particularly in cases where it is difficult to give liquid or powder products to the cat, capsule bottle form products can offer an easier application option. Dosage should be adjusted according to usage instructions and used in accordance with FIPGL23 recommendations.
