## What does Powder Form mean?

Powder form products usually involve the use of an active ingredient in powder form. These types of products are usually turned into a solution by mixing with water or another liquid and can usually be applied by mixing directly into the cat's food.

Particularly in cases where it is difficult to give liquid products to the cat, powder form products can offer an easier application option. Dosage should be adjusted according to usage instructions and used in accordance with FIPGL23 recommendations.
