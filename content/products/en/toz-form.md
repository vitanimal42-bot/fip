FIP (Feline Infectious Peritonitis) treatment is a process that requires long-term patience and regular application for both the cat and its owner. During this period, choosing the right pharmaceutical form increases the success of the treatment. Powder form products offer a practical and effective solution, especially in cases where clinical application is difficult.

### Practical and stress-free application
Some cats may show high resistance to oral (capsule/tablet) or injectable applications. For such cats:
* It is easily consumed by mixing it with wet food or treats.
* The stress of application during the treatment process is minimized.
* Regularity of treatment is ensured without disturbing the cat's natural feeding routine.

### Advantageous in street cats and large populations
Powder form is the most ideal option for cats whose clinical follow-up is difficult or for cats living in shelters/colonies. It allows for the treatment of multiple cats simultaneously and practically.

### High patient compliance and sustainability
FIP treatment usually continues for 90 days. The sustainability of such a long period depends on the ease of application. Powder form allows for the treatment to be completed without interruption by increasing owner compliance.

### Gastrointestinal tolerance and absorption
Powder form products are formulated to be compatible with the cat's digestive system. When consumed with food:
* Gastric irritation risk is low.
* It is effectively absorbed and enters the systemic circulation.
* It is a safe alternative for cats with sensitive stomachs.

### Effective dosage management
Powder form allows for dosage according to the cat's weight. Dosage standardization is ensured by using the measuring spoon or scales recommended by the veterinarian.

### Clinical success and comfort
Regular use of powder form contributes to clinical success by ensuring that the active substance reaches the therapeutic level. It is a preferred form due to both its efficacy and the comfort it provides to the cat and its owner.
