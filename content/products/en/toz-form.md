FIP (Feline Infectious Peritonitis) treatment is a process that requires long-term and regular application. The form of the product used in this process is of great importance, especially in terms of application accessibility. Powder form products offer a practical and sustainable solution for cats that are difficult to handle.

### Easy application for street cats and cats that are difficult to catch
In street cats or semi-domestic cats:
* Difficulty in catching and restraining
* High stress response to manual handling
* Tablet or injectable application being impractical
are common situations.

🔹 Since powder form products can be applied by mixing with daily food without the need for manual contact, they allow for the sustainability of treatment in such cats.

### Practical use with food
Powder form:
* Can be given with the food the cat is used to
* Applied without disturbing the daily feeding routine
* No need for forceful applications
This situation provides a great advantage, especially in field conditions.

### Alternative to tablet and capsule administration
For cats that have difficulty swallowing tablets or capsules and do not allow direct oral administration, the powder form offers an effective alternative as long as oral intake is possible.

### Reduction of stress and application-related risks
Powder form application:
* Reduces stress for the cat and the caregiver
* Lowers risks such as biting and scratching
* Reduces the likelihood of the treatment being left unfinished.
