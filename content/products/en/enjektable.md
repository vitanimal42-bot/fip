## What does Injectable Form mean?

Injectable form products usually involve the direct administration of liquid active ingredients into the body via a syringe. It is given by subcutaneous injection and shows its effect either locally or systematically.

Particularly when it is difficult to give oral products or other forms to the cat, injectable form products can provide an effective and fast treatment option. Dosage should be adjusted according to the usage instructions and used in accordance with FIPGL23 recommendations.
