FIP (Feline Infectious Peritonitis) treatment requires a fast, controlled, and reliable approach, especially in severe and advanced cases. The application form of the product used in this process is critical for the sustainability of treatment.

### Safe use when oral intake is not possible in severe cases
In advanced FIP cases:
* Weakening or loss of the swallowing reflex
* Loss of appetite and not eating
* Resistance to oral medication application
are frequently observed.

🔹 In such cases, injectable products allow for the continuous maintenance of treatment without the need for oral intake and offer a vital alternative.

### Effect independent of the gastrointestinal system
Injectable application bypasses the gastrointestinal system:
* Without being affected by vomiting and regurgitation
* Without loss of absorption
* Provides direct participation in the systemic circulation
This feature increases treatment efficacy in severe clinical pictures.

### Rapid and predictable bioavailability
Injectable form:
* Ensures rapid entry of the active substance into the circulation
* Contributes to the earlier observation of clinical response
* Minimizes absorption differences
This advantage is critical, especially in patients with poor general condition.

### Dose control and clinical safety
Injectable products:
* Allow for precise and controlled dose application
* Eliminate the risk of dose loss and irregular intake
* Provide maximum safety under veterinary supervision

### Efficacy in critical and initial periods of treatment
Injectable form provides a significant advantage especially:
* In acute and severe stages of the disease
* In cases where oral medication is not possible
* In cases where treatment needs to be started quickly
