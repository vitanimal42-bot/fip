FIP (Feline Infectious Peritonitis) treatment is a serious clinical process that requires rapid and effective intervention. The pharmaceutical form and quality of the product used in this process are the most important factors determining the success of the treatment. Injectable form products have a critical place, especially in the early stages of treatment and in severe clinical cases.

### Rapid absorption and bioavailability
Injectable products enter the systemic circulation rapidly without passing through the gastrointestinal tract. This situation is vital for FIP cases with severe clinical symptoms and general condition disorders.

### Precise and safe dosage control
Injectable application provides the opportunity to apply the exact amount of dose determined by the veterinarian. Dose losses that may be encountered in oral applications (vomiting, loss of appetite, etc.) are eliminated in injectable form.

### Vital importance in acute and neurological cases
Injectable form is the first choice, especially in neurological and ocular FIP cases where the blood-brain barrier needs to be crossed and in acute cases where the general condition is rapidly deteriorating. High bioavailability ensures that the active substance reaches the target tissues at the desired level.

### Continuity and monitoring of treatment
The start of treatment with injectable form allows the patient's response to be observed more clearly. Clinicians can determine the response to treatment more accurately by providing dose standardization.

### Professional treatment management
Injectable application allows for the treatment protocol to be followed more strictly under the supervision of a veterinarian and the clinic. This is a critical factor in minimizing the risk of treatment failure.

Injectable form products provide the clinician and the patient owner with the most reliable start and support in the fight against FIP, with their high efficacy and rapid response.
