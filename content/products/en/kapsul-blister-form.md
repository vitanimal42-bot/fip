FIP (Feline Infectious Peritonitis) treatment is a process that requires long-term, regular, and correct dose application. The pharmaceutical form of the product used in this process directly affects the success of the treatment. Capsule form products offer significant advantages in terms of ease of application and dose safety.

### Correct and standard dose application
Capsule form:
* Provides a constant and standard dose in every application
* Reduces the risk of dose errors in home applications
* Helps maintain the treatment protocol determined by the veterinarian

### Continuity of application in long-term treatments
FIP treatment usually covers an application period of 90 days or more. Capsule form:
* Facilitates daily application
* Increases owner compliance
* Reduces the risk of direct treatment discontinuation

### Reduction of taste and odor problems
Cats are extremely sensitive to taste and odor. Capsule form:
* Limits the direct contact of the active substance in the mouth
* Reduces the risk of excessive salivation and vomiting
* Reduces resistance behaviors during application

### Gastrointestinal tolerance
Capsule form products:
* Dissolve more controlled in the stomach
* Reduces oral and esophageal irritation
* Lowers the risk of gastrointestinal side effects

### Stability and protection of active substance
Capsule form:
* Provides protection against environmental factors such as light and moisture
* Contributes to the stability of the active substance throughout the treatment period

### Less stress for owner and cat
Capsule application:
* Is completed in a short time
* Reduces daily application stress
* Supports the sustainability of long-term treatments
