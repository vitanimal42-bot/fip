FIP (Feline Infectious Peritonitis) treatment is a serious process that requires long-term, regular, and correct dose administration. The pharmaceutical form of the product used in this process directly affects the success of the treatment.

### Correct dose and application standard
Tablet form products provide a fixed and standard dose at each administration. In this way, the risk of dose errors in home applications is reduced and the treatment protocol determined by the veterinarian is preserved.

### Continuity for long-term treatments
FIP treatment usually covers an application period of 90 days or more. Tablet form helps to sustain treatment without interruption by facilitating daily use and increases owner compliance.

### Gastrointestinal tolerance
Considering the loss of appetite and gastrointestinal sensitivity common in cats with FIP, the tablet form:
* Reduces oral and esophageal irritation
* Provides controlled dissolution in the stomach
* Lowers the risk of vomiting and dose loss

### Active substance stability
Tablet form products are more resistant to light, moisture and environmental factors. This situation contributes to the active substance remaining stable throughout the treatment period and showing a predictable effect.

### Clinical follow-up and safe use
Thanks to the tablet form:
* Daily dose tracking becomes easier
* Clinical records are kept more clearly
* Response to treatment is evaluated more healthily

These features are of great importance in diseases that need to be closely monitored such as FIP.

### Less stress for owner and cat
Tablet administration is practical and takes less time compared to forms that require liquid or measurement. This reduces the daily stress of both the cat and its owner, making the treatment process more sustainable.
