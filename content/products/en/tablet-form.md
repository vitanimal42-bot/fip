## What does Tablet Form mean?

Tablet form products usually involve the use of active ingredients that have been processed into a compressed powder form. These types of products show their effect by dissolving in the stomach or intestines after the tablet is swallowed and can usually be given directly into the cat's mouth or applied by mixing into its food.

Particularly in cases where it is difficult to give liquid or powder products to the cat, tablet form products can offer an easier application option. Swallowing the tablet can sometimes be difficult; in this case, crushing it and mixing it into food can be tried. Dosage should be adjusted according to usage instructions and used in accordance with FIPGL23 recommendations.
