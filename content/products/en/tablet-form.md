FIP (Feline Infectious Peritonitis) treatment is a serious process that requires long-term, regular, and correct dose application. The pharmaceutical form of the product used in this process directly affects the success of the treatment.

### Accurate dose and application standard
Tablet form products offer a constant and standard dose in every application. This reduces the risk of dose errors in home applications and helps maintain the treatment protocol determined by the veterinarian.

### Continuity for long-term treatments
FIP treatment usually covers an application period of 90 days or more. Tablet form helps maintain the treatment uninterrupted by making daily use easier and increases owner compliance.

### Gastrointestinal tolerance
Considering the loss of appetite and gastrointestinal sensitivity often seen in cats with FIP, tablet form:
* Reduces oral and esophageal irritation
* Provides controlled dissolution in the stomach
* Lowers the risk of vomiting and dose loss

### Active substance stability
Tablet form products are more resistant to light, moisture, and environmental factors. This situation contributes to the active substance remaining stable throughout the treatment period and showing a predictable effect.

### Clinical monitoring and safe use
Thanks to tablet form:
* Daily dose tracking becomes easier
* Clinical records are kept more clearly
* The response to treatment is evaluated more healthily

These features are of great importance in diseases that need to be monitored closely, such as FIP.

### Less stress for owner and cat
Tablet application is done in a shorter time and in a more practical way compared to forms that require liquid or measurement. This makes the treatment process more sustainable by reducing the daily stress of both the cat and its owner.
